Title: A Simple Reddit Clone
Author: Rafael Sánchez Aguilú

This is a simple Reddit made during two evenings.

A quick rundown:

- A link can be submitted by using the submission form at the top. You have to click the 'submit' button. Pressing 'enter' doesn't work.

- Write the url without the 'http://'; it is added later.

- You can upvote and downvote posts by clicking on the up and down arrows. The posts will automatically sort themselves.

- Every post is saved in localStorage. I still haven't added the ability to delete posts so they can only be erased by clearing localStorage.
